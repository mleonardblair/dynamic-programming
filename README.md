# Dynamic Programming (DP) - LeetCode

This submodule contains solutions to LeetCode problems that utilize **Dynamic Programming** (DP) techniques.  
Each solution is written with clarity and efficiency in mind, including detailed explanations of the approach, intuition, and complexity analysis.

## Why Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is a fundamental technique used to solve problems that can be broken down into overlapping subproblems. Mastery of DP is useful for success in technical interviews and real-world algorithmic problem-solving.

Common patterns include:
- Memoization
- Tabulation
- State Transition Formulas
- Optimization Techniques (e.g., Space Optimization)
